## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for FLUTTER_SCREEN_WORKFLOW_COMPONENT_FIRST

#### SCREEN_BY_SCREEN_FLOW

- Implement one screen at a time and close it fully before starting the next screen.
- For each screen, identify reusable components first and implement them as separate tasks.
- Compose the screen only after required reusable components are completed.

#### SPEC_LOCK_BEFORE_UI

- Before implementing visual layout, collect and lock Figma specs for the target node:
  - frame size and safe areas,
  - spacing and alignment,
  - typography values,
  - colors and layer order.
- Do not approximate missing visual values without documenting a temporary assumption.

#### COMPONENT_FIRST_RULE

- Repeated visual blocks must live in shared reusable widgets.
- Avoid duplicating screen-specific layout code for elements already represented by reusable components.
- Keep component APIs explicit (size presets, alignment, spacing variants).

#### ONE_TO_ONE_VALIDATION

- Every completed screen requires a visual comparison against Figma references.
- Verify at least two viewport sizes and both Android/iOS behavior for user-facing parity.
- If there are visual deviations, list each one with rationale and acceptance decision.

#### QUALITY_GATES

- Run `flutter analyze` and relevant tests before marking any screen task as done.
- Run platform build checks at screen milestone level (`apk` debug and iOS simulator build where possible).
