## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for MOBILE_PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE

#### PRIVACY_BASELINE

- Maintain a public privacy policy aligned with actual data behavior.
- Collect only data required for gameplay, platform services, or operational stability.
- Keep user-facing descriptions accurate for every permission and data usage.

#### STORE_COMPLIANCE

- Keep Google Play Data safety declarations updated before each release.
- Keep Apple privacy nutrition labels updated before each release.
- Ensure required age/content ratings are accurate for game content.

#### TRACKING_AND_CONSENT

- Do not enable tracking-related SDK behavior without explicit product decision and policy updates.
- If consent is required by platform/region, implement a clear opt-in flow before data collection.

#### SECURITY_AND_SECRETS

- Never commit secrets, signing credentials, or private keys to repository.
- Keep production credentials in secure local/system stores and document setup steps safely.
