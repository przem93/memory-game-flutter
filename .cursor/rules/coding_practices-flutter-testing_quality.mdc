## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for FLUTTER_TESTING_QUALITY

#### TEST_STRATEGY

- Cover core game logic with deterministic unit tests.
- Cover critical UI behaviors with widget tests.
- Cover end-to-end player paths with integration tests for major releases.
- Keep tests fast, isolated, and stable in local runs.

#### MINIMUM_TEST_EXPECTATIONS

- New game mechanics require unit tests for success and edge cases.
- New UI screens require widget tests for rendering and interactions.
- Regression fixes must include a test that fails before and passes after the fix.

#### VISUAL_REGRESSION

- Use golden tests for key screens/components where practical.
- Update goldens intentionally and review diffs before accepting changes.

#### DONE_CRITERIA

- Feature is not done until required tests are present and passing.
- Analyzer, formatter, and tests must pass locally before PR.
- Platform-impacting changes should be verified on Android and iOS targets.
