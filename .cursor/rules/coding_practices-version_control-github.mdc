## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews.
- Use a minimal PR checklist for every change:
  - local tests and analyzer status,
  - impacted platforms (Android/iOS/both),
  - screenshots for UI changes (with Figma reference),
  - release/process impact (if any).
- Implement branch protection rules for default branches to enforce quality checks.
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting.
- Prefer small, reviewable PRs with clear scope boundaries.
- Use GitHub Projects/Issues to track roadmap and release preparation tasks.
- Keep CI/CD optional for now, but structure workflows so manual release can be automated later.
