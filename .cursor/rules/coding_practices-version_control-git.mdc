## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages.
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/shared-*` for cross-platform Dart changes,
  - `feature/ios-*` for iOS-specific work,
  - `feature/android-*` for Android-specific work,
  - `release/*` and `hotfix/*` for stabilization and production fixes.
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what.
- Keep commits focused on one logical change to simplify review and rollback.
- Include platform scope in commits/PRs when a change is platform-specific.
- Before opening a PR, run formatting, static analysis, and tests locally.
- Leverage git hooks (when configured) to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes.
