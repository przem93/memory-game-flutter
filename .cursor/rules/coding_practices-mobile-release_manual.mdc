## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for MOBILE_RELEASE_MANUAL

#### RELEASE_MODEL

- Use manual release flow for both stores until CI/CD is explicitly introduced.
- Keep release checklist documents current in `/docs`.
- Every release must include version bump, release notes, and changelog updates.

#### ANDROID_RELEASE_CHECKS

- Validate signing configuration and keystore access.
- Verify package id, versionCode/versionName, and target SDK compatibility.
- Confirm required store listing assets and Data safety details are updated.
- Test install/upgrade path on at least one physical Android device.

#### IOS_RELEASE_CHECKS

- Validate signing identities/profiles and bundle identifier.
- Verify build/archive settings and App Store Connect metadata.
- Confirm Privacy Nutrition labels and policy links are current.
- Test build on physical iOS device and run TestFlight smoke verification.

#### RELEASE_DECISION

- Block release when critical gameplay, crash, or compliance issues are unresolved.
- Keep a simple rollback/hotfix plan for production defects.
