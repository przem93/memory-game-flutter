## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### DOC_UPDATES

- Update relevant documentation in `/docs` when modifying features, release flow, or platform integrations.
- Keep `README.md` in sync with:
  - Flutter setup prerequisites,
  - local run/test commands,
  - Android/iOS platform notes,
  - release process expectations.
- Document any new dependency and why it was introduced.
- For UI updates, include before/after screenshots and mention Figma node coverage in PR notes.
- Maintain release documentation for manual publishing:
  - version bumps,
  - signing artifacts expectations,
  - store metadata updates.
- Maintain changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md` when user-visible behavior changes.
