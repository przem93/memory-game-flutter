## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for MOBILE_PLATFORM_SERVICES

#### GAME_SERVICES_INTEGRATION

- Integrate iOS Game Center for supported leaderboard/achievement flows.
- Integrate Android Google Play Games Services equivalent for the same flows.
- Keep service integration behind shared interfaces to maintain feature parity.

#### FALLBACK_AND_RESILIENCE

- Gameplay must remain fully usable offline without platform service connectivity.
- If sign-in or service initialization fails, continue in local mode without blocking gameplay.
- Queue or ignore non-critical remote score operations gracefully; never crash core game flow.

#### ACCOUNT_AND_IDENTITY

- Request platform sign-in only where needed for leaderboard/achievement features.
- Avoid making login mandatory for core single-player gameplay.
- Clearly communicate when scores are local-only versus synced/platform-backed.

#### IMPLEMENTATION_GUARDRAILS

- Keep platform channel code minimal and well-isolated.
- Add integration notes for required console/app-id setup changes.
- Verify behavior on both platforms whenever game services logic changes.
