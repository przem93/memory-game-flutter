# AI Rules for Memory Game (Flutter)

## PROJECT_CONTEXT

- Product: single-player memory game built in Flutter.
- Target platforms: Android and iOS from one shared codebase.
- Distribution: Google Play and Apple App Store.
- Design source of truth: Figma file `Memory-game-design` (`fALJoRbR9Mxao3BintsOoJ`).

## PRODUCT_SCOPE

### MVP_SCOPE

- Core game loop works fully offline.
- Local gameplay and score tracking must work without network access.
- Platform game services are integrated when available:
  - iOS: Game Center for leaderboards/achievements where relevant.
  - Android: Google Play Games Services equivalent for leaderboards/achievements.
- If platform services are unavailable, app behavior must gracefully fallback to local-only mode.

### ROADMAP_SCOPE

- Future phases may include cloud sync, extended profiles, events, and social features.
- CI/CD release automation can be added after the manual process is stable.
- Observability (analytics and crash reporting) should be added after MVP stability.

## ENGINEERING_BASELINE

- Language/runtime: Dart + stable Flutter SDK.
- Platforms: maintain parity across Android and iOS for user-facing features.
- UI behavior:
  - responsive layouts for phones and tablets,
  - consistent spacing/typography/components from Figma tokens,
  - accessibility support (scalable text, contrast, semantic labels).
- Architecture direction: clear separation of presentation/domain/data concerns and reusable components.

## QUALITY_GATES

- No critical crashes in core gameplay paths.
- Smooth interactions and animations on common mid-range devices.
- Deterministic game logic covered by tests.
- UI changes validated against Figma screenshots for key screens.
- New features must include platform impact notes (Android/iOS) before merge.

## RELEASE_ARTIFACTS

- Store-ready app icons, splash assets, screenshots, and descriptions.
- Proper app signing setup for both platforms.
- Versioning and release notes maintained for each store submission.
- Privacy policy and store privacy declarations updated before release.

## WORKFLOW

- Build and release are manual for now (local validation + store console submissions).
- Keep documentation (`README.md`, `/docs`) aligned with feature and release process changes.
- Rules in `.cursor/rules` are authoritative implementation guidance and should be kept consistent.
