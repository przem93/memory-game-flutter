## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for FLUTTER_UI_FROM_FIGMA

#### FIGMA_IMPLEMENTATION

- Treat Figma as visual source of truth for spacing, typography, colors, and component hierarchy.
- Build reusable Flutter widgets for repeating Figma components before duplicating UI code.
- Convert absolute design values into tokenized scales (spacing, radius, typography sizes).
- Preserve visual parity for key screens while keeping Flutter code maintainable.

#### RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT

- Implement layouts that adapt to phone and tablet sizes.
- Use constraints-based composition over fixed-position assumptions.
- Define behavior for narrow, medium, and wide breakpoints.

#### DESIGN_TOKENS

- Centralize colors, text styles, spacing, and elevations in theme/token classes.
- Avoid hard-coded style literals in feature widgets unless justified and documented.
- Map Figma color/text styles to named tokens to support future design iteration.

#### REVIEW_STANDARD

- For every substantial UI change, include screenshot comparison against Figma references.
- Document intentional visual deviations and technical rationale in PR description.
- Prefer incremental UI pull requests when implementing large Figma sections.
