## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable Flutter solutions over verbose code.
- Prioritize separation of concerns (UI widgets vs domain logic vs data access).
- Highlight potential performance implications:
  - unnecessary rebuilds,
  - expensive widget trees,
  - non-cached image/asset usage.
- Frame solutions within architecture choices and suggest alternatives when tradeoffs exist.
- Focus comments on why, not what; rely on clear naming and composable widgets.
- Proactively address platform-specific differences (Android/iOS services, permissions, lifecycle).
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostics (repro steps, logs, profiling strategy).
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategy for Flutter:
  - unit tests for game logic,
  - widget tests for UI behavior,
  - integration tests for critical flows.
